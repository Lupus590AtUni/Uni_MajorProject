~~Splines with curve to identify corners~~

~~Curve fitting to humanise the path~~

future goal? To further humanise the path: player is not always given the fastest, priority is making sure the player doesn't get lost - more landmarks, less turns

~~colour blind mode? menu option to disable colours?~~

Data which could be collected:
* Where was the player when they pushed the 'got there' button
* How far the test player diverges from the path
 * ~~Did they go towards other landmarks (some may look interesting and be disractions)~~
* How long the test player takes to reach the destination
* ~~How often the test player asks the game for more directions~~

Questionare:
* The test players opinions - make these binary choice (Natural language or waypoint):
  * Which guidance technique did they think took them longer
  * Which guidance technique the test player preferred over all
  * Which they consider more immersive
  * Which allowed them to have more appreciation of the game world
  * Naturaul language instuctions where clear?
* does the player drive?
  * Do they use a Sat Nav?
* Age Brackets?
* Gender?
* Prior Game Experience?
  * What type of games?
  * Regular player?
  * Played on PC before?
